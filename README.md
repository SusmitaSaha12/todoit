# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### start 
- react app install
- npm install redux react-redux
- npm install --save-dev @redux-devtools/core 
### store js create 
- npm i redux-devtools-extension
- npm install redux-thunk
### use store in react app
- goto index js file & import Provider
- wrape app component inside provider & set the store props by calling configstore method
- create redux folder
- store js transfer to redux folder
- create reducers js 
### reducers js 
- define all action types as constants {create constants js & initialize action type names}
- then define initial state
- add the reducers login using switch case based on action types
- after that ensure the reducers has been included in the store js file
- new todo create in reducer 
### action js
- action create inside action js using constants js
- for dispatch action i need to create component
- so Newtodo js created & render NewTodo inside App component
### Material Ui define for css
- npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
- npm install @mui/material @mui/styled-engine-sc styled-components
